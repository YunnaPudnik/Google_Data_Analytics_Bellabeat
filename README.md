## Data analysis of "Bellabeat", Capstone study

This document is created as a part of the capstone project of the Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate.

**Scenario**
Bellabeat is a successful small company, but they have the potential to become a larger player in the global smart device market. Stakeholders  believe that analyzing smart device fitness data could help unlock new growth opportunities for the company. Analysts have been asked to focus on one of Bellabeat’s products and analyze smart device data to gain insight into how consumers are using their smart devices. The insights you discover will then help guide marketing strategy for the company. 

**About the Company**
Bellabeat is a high-tech company that manufactures health-focused smart products. Collecting data on activity, sleep, stress, and reproductive health has allowed Bellabeat to empower women with knowledge about their own health and habits. Since it was founded in 2013, Bellabeat has grown rapidly and quickly positioned itself as a tech-driven wellness company for women. By 2016, Bellabeat had opened offices around the world and launched multiple products.

Further analysis is based on six steps of the data analysis process: ask, prepare, process, analyze, share, and act.

# STEP 1: ASK

Three main questions to answer:

1. What are some trends in smart device usage? 
2. How could these trends apply to Bellabeat customers? 
3. How could these trends help influence Bellabeat marketing strategy?

**Business task:**

Analyze smart device usage data in order to gain insight into how consumers use non-Bellabeat smart devices, find trends in smart devices usage and use these trends to influence Bellabeat marketing strategy.

**Stakeholders:**

Primary: Bellabeat’s co founder and Chief Creative Officer

Secondary: Bellabeat’s marketing analytics team

# STEP 2: PREPARE

The data will be used as Fitabase Data for the period of 4.12.16 - 5.12.16. Dataset made available through Mobius. The dataset contains 18 csv files, each file contains different health related data.

**Data Limitations:**

Due to the limitation of size (30 users) and not having any demographic information we could encounter a sampling bias. We are not sure if the sample is representative of the population as a whole. Another problem we would encounter is that the dataset is not current and also the time limitation of the survey.

# STEP 3: PROCESS

During the process step, I check and clean duplicates, nulls, format and merge data for further analysis.

**Tool:** R programming is used for data manipulation.

# STEP 4: Analyze

All data aggregations and analysis are performed in R studio (link)

# STEP 5: Share

Google Slides is used to perform the presentation, which contains main data points, summary and recommendations for further actions([link]

# STEP 6: Act

**Analysis shows:**
- Almost half of participants lives either lightly active or sedentary lifestyle, but 33% are into very active lifestyle.
- People tend to walk less on Sunday and barely touch minimum number of step throughout a week.
- People with sedentary lifestyle burn the least calories. 
- Our participants sleep around 7 hours a night. And users of very active lifestyle sleep around 5 hours on average, which is 3 hours less than required amount.

**Recommendations:**
- Introduce benefits of regular 8 hours sleep to users. Develop short pre-sleep meditations. Also, offer people to set their sleep time alarm, so they can handle rest time better.
- Create and promote weekend activities (e.g. Yoga class, Cardio trainings, and etc), in order to keep users active on Sundays. 
- Explain how 10.000 step a day can positively influence user’s health and offer a place for a walk nearby.
- Promote psychotherapy for users with sleep issues.
- Make discounts bonuses available for the most active users, to encourage them keep going.
- 
**Next step:**
- Create a survey for people with sedentary lifestyle and lightly active lifestyle to find out reasons  and engage them accordingly.
